\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {4.1}{\ignorespaces Simplified view of our approach. Left: At time t=1, the actor gets a PEX message from peer A and learns that peer A is connected to peer B and C. At t=2, the actor gets PEX messages from peers C and A. The actor learns that now peer A is connected to peer D. Thus the actor knows the properties of peer A at t=1 and t=2.\relax }}{19}
