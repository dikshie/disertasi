% The thesis guidelines stipulate that "The two copies of the thesis for
% examination should be soft-bound (not ringbound) and printed on one side of
% the page only. It is required that the hard-bound copy of a thesis will be
% printed on both sides of the page on paper of a weight of at least 90 gsm"
% Therefore, use 
%
%   \documentclass[oneside]{tcd-phd-thesis}
%
% for the copy for examination, but
%
%   \documentclass[twoside]{tcd-phd-thesis}

% "1.33.11 References. Systematic and complete reference to sources used and a
% classified list of all sources used must be included in the thesis. The
% titles of journals preferably should not be abbreviated; if they are,
% abbreviations must comply with an internationally recognised system (the
% format may vary according to the precedents and customs of the subject area;
% graduate students should consult with their Supervisor as to appropriate
% presentation)." 
%
% Replace "acm" by a different style for different styles of references (try
% "abbrv", "alpha", "apalike", "ieeetr", "plain" or "siam"). This affects the
% style of references within the text, the ordering of the bibliography, etc.
